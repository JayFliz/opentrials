      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <p>
        The entire OpenTrials database is saved monthly automatically. This
        is what we use to power our API, and contains everything that you can
        see on this website. Having the entire database in your local machine
        allows you to analyze the data using your favorite tool, or even create
        your own copy of the OpenTrials API.
      </p>
      <p>
        As with any usage of OpenTrials's data, make sure you read and
        understand our <a href="/terms-of-use">Terms of use</a>.

          Below are the latest available dumps of our database. Their
          file names contain the date at which the dump was produced:
        </p>
        <ul>
          {% for dump in dumps | sort(true, false, 'label') %}
          <li>
            <a href="{{ dump.url }}" rel="external">
                {{ dump.label }}
            </a> ({{ dump.size | formatBytes }})
          </li>
          {% endfor %}
        </ul>
      {% else %}
        <p>
          Unfortunately, something went wrong and the list of dumps could
          not be obtained. Please try again later. If the issue remains,
          please <a href="/flag-error?url={{ currentURL | urlencode }}">let us
          know</a>.

      <h2>How to use</h2>
      <p>
        The dump files you can download above were generated using the <a
        href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.4/static/app-pgdump.html"
        rel="external">pg_dump</a> command of PostgreSQL 9.4. To load it, you
        need a local database running PostgreSQL 9.4 or newer.
      </p>

      <p>
        Assuming you have a database called <em>DATABASE</em> created in a
        PostgreSQL 9.4+ server running on <em>HOST</em>, with user
        <em>USER</em>, you can restore a dump named
        <em>OPENTRIALS_DUMP.dump</em> by opening a command line and running:
        <pre>
    pg_restore --no-owner --no-acl --create --host=HOST --username=USER --dbname=DATABASE OPENTRIALS_DUMP.dump
        </pre>
      </p>

      <p>
        Please refer to the <a
        href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.4/static/backup-dump.html"
        rel="external">PostgreSQL documentation</a> for more information about
        the restoring process.
